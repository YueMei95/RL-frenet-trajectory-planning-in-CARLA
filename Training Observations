In CarlaGymEnv-95: The state vector used to be: 

[point_ahead.x, point_ahead.y, point_ahead.z,
ego_transform.location.x, ego_transform.location.y, ego_transform.location.z,
ego_transform.rotation.yaw, speed, self.targetSpeed, w.x, w.y, w.z]

where point_ahead is in initial frame. During the training for 1M steps max eps mean rew was ~300. 

In CarlaGymEnv-v1 I changed obs vector to:

[point_ahead_b[0], point_ahead_b[1], speed, self.targetSpeed, w.x, w.y, w.z]

where point_ahead is in body frame. in 1M steps max eps mean rew increased to ~800 and the agent finished the entire race for 37 times.
